A bitmap file, also known as a BMP file, is a common image file format that stores graphical data in a grid of pixels.
Each pixel in the grid is represented by a combination of red, green and blue (RGB) values, which determines the color of that particular pixel.

To begin working with the bitmap file, I first learned how to create a blank screen by generating a BMP file with no content.
This involved understanding the structure and format of a BMP  file and how to set the appropriate header information.

Next, I explored how to manipulate the window size and other properties of the file.
I learned how to change the colors of specific pixel(s) in the file by using different values in the RGB matrix.
This allowed me to customize the appearance of my file.
